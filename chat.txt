6/30/23, 8:50 PM - Nithin AIML added you
6/30/23, 8:50 PM - Nithin AIML: https://sites.google.com/view/aisome/aisome?pli=1
6/30/23, 8:50 PM - Nithin AIML: very good chance to work☝🏼
6/30/23, 8:51 PM - Nithin AIML: Pls go through it in detail
6/30/23, 8:51 PM - Nithin AIML: Data set will be provided
6/30/23, 8:51 PM - nagaraj_poojari: have u worked with text classification models ?
6/30/23, 8:51 PM - Nithin AIML: Kind off
6/30/23, 8:52 PM - Nithin AIML: But it was like spam ham
6/30/23, 8:52 PM - Nithin AIML: Positive -ve
6/30/23, 8:52 PM - Nithin AIML: But this is a step ahead
6/30/23, 8:52 PM - Nithin AIML: Soo its important to know wt to do n how to build
6/30/23, 8:53 PM - nagaraj_poojari: hm, a text can contain multiple label
6/30/23, 8:53 PM - Nithin AIML: Yeahh
6/30/23, 8:53 PM - Nithin AIML: Actually there was a senior who used graphical neural networks for the same problem
6/30/23, 8:54 PM - Nithin AIML: Its different ai model sop
6/30/23, 8:54 PM - nagaraj_poojari: yhea
6/30/23, 8:54 PM - Nithin AIML: So* building uniquely matters
6/30/23, 8:54 PM - nagaraj_poojari: but for text , transformers works well right
6/30/23, 8:54 PM - Varun ISE: but accuracy matters
6/30/23, 8:54 PM - Nithin AIML: I can contact them through my cls teacher Sowmya maam ip
6/30/23, 8:55 PM - Varun ISE: no we can go with bert
6/30/23, 8:55 PM - Nithin AIML: They said that trains much quicker n with more accurately
6/30/23, 8:55 PM - Nithin AIML: Sooo i choose that
6/30/23, 8:55 PM - Nithin AIML: @916362688458 was there u remember?
6/30/23, 8:55 PM - Nithin AIML: GNN
6/30/23, 8:55 PM - Nithin AIML: I called u to see that
6/30/23, 8:56 PM - Nithin AIML: Wt u think abt it
6/30/23, 8:56 PM - Nithin AIML: Wt it is

6/30/23, 8:57 PM - Nithin AIML: We will discuss with them n go through it
6/30/23, 8:57 PM - nagaraj_poojari: state of art models
6/30/23, 8:57 PM - Nithin AIML: On wt
6/30/23, 8:58 PM - nagaraj_poojari: the existing text classification models that worked well for different datasets
6/30/23, 8:59 PM - Nithin AIML: Ok cool cool
6/30/23, 9:01 PM - Varun ISE: So let's distribute the roles
6/30/23, 9:02 PM - Varun ISE: Someone come forward and assign the roles
6/30/23, 9:02 PM - Nithin AIML: I seriously dk
6/30/23, 9:02 PM - Nithin AIML: @917019096676 or @916362688458  do that
6/30/23, 9:03 PM - nagaraj_poojari: now the only goal is to study and understand the existing models
6/30/23, 9:03 PM - Nithin AIML: @916362688458 ninna kardirade edun madak distrubute madu
6/30/23, 9:03 PM - Nithin AIML: Truee
6/30/23, 9:04 PM - Nithin AIML: Lets all study m understand as he said
6/30/23, 9:04 PM - Nithin AIML: N start on
6/30/23, 9:04 PM - Varun ISE: @917019096676 and @919980549538 you do the heavy lifting give me light work because I'm a beginner
6/30/23, 9:05 PM - Nithin AIML: Do this we will see

7/1/23, 10:05 PM - Nithin AIML: Did anything new today?????
7/1/23, 10:06 PM - Nithin AIML: So basically classification for a data is not a big deal but
7/1/23, 10:06 PM - Nithin AIML: Mentioning all label it belongs to matters
7/1/23, 10:06 PM - Nithin AIML: So try knowing it
7/1/23, 10:07 PM - Nithin AIML: 1. Nlp to converted to numerical data -one hot encoding n so on refer yt for more detail how n all
7/1/23, 10:08 PM - Nithin AIML: 2.numerical data need to be classified
7/1/23, 10:08 PM - Nithin AIML: 3. Mention all classified data
7/1/23, 10:08 PM - Nithin AIML: 4. Accuracy matters
7/1/23, 10:09 PM - Nithin AIML: 5. Try to do it with some models with are not familiar to most note: carrying all 1.2.3.4
7/1/23, 10:10 PM - Nithin AIML: 6. If model is unique n as more accuracy then its waitage
7/1/23, 10:10 PM - nagaraj_poojari: embedding matters a lot
7/1/23, 10:10 PM - Nithin AIML: Mark all this n we will dive from Monday
7/1/23, 10:11 PM - Nithin AIML: Disclaimer: heavy compitition
7/1/23, 10:11 PM - Nithin AIML: Yeah i missed that
7/1/23, 10:12 PM - Nithin AIML: Guys go through all 6 wt to build n how to build
7/1/23, 10:12 PM - Nithin AIML: Focus on this
7/1/23, 10:12 PM - Nithin AIML: @917019096676
7/1/23, 10:12 PM - Nithin AIML: Like all 3 labels need to be mentioned how anta

7/1/23, 10:16 PM - Varun ISE: @919980549538 what to learn theory or implementation
7/1/23, 10:16 PM - nagaraj_poojari: 👍
7/1/23, 10:16 PM - Nithin AIML: All concepts from scratch
7/1/23, 10:17 PM - Varun ISE: Means practice or knowing the concept
7/1/23, 10:21 PM - nagaraj_poojari: to access there data we need to fill a form and mail them, 
do we need any college sign on it  ?
7/1/23, 10:22 PM - Nithin AIML: No idea i don't think soo
7/1/23, 10:22 PM - Nithin AIML: Shall we fill that now
7/1/23, 10:23 PM - Nithin AIML: Nagraj do that

7/1/23, 10:34 PM - nagaraj_poojari: i didn't get it
7/1/23, 10:36 PM - Nithin AIML: Ig we don't have any right on our project its selected
7/1/23, 10:36 PM - nagaraj_poojari: why
7/1/23, 10:36 PM - nagaraj_poojari: its just for data access
7/1/23, 10:37 PM - Nithin AIML: Oh ok
7/1/23, 10:37 PM - Nithin AIML: I thought for project
7/1/23, 10:43 PM - nagaraj_poojari: just give a team name ,

7/5/23, 5:08 PM - Nithin AIML: God!!! We talked like 40 mins
7/5/23, 5:08 PM - Nithin AIML: He actually gave some valuable points to implement
7/5/23, 5:09 PM - Nithin AIML: Lemme tell wt we spoke n i asked to create a group with him if in case of any issues
7/5/23, 5:10 PM - Nithin AIML: Points we discussed
1.cleaning plays a crucial role model doesn't have much to do with accuracy there were we all go wrong
7/5/23, 5:11 PM - Nithin AIML: Soooo "our motive is not to build a new model its to clean a data very properly "
7/5/23, 5:12 PM - Nithin AIML: Like doesn't should be does not but our nltk takes that as does n gives positive
7/5/23, 5:13 PM - Nithin AIML: 2.Soo nltk is outdated he suggested to use spaCy which is recent n most used
7/5/23, 5:14 PM - Nithin AIML: In nltk u have to remove like "not" etc in stopwords
7/5/23, 5:14 PM - Nithin AIML: N like u as you r as are n so on
7/5/23, 5:16 PM - Nithin AIML: 3. Try TFIDF than countervectorization as it gives weight n know how to remove a make a optimized vector
7/5/23, 5:17 PM - Nithin AIML: LDA is linear dicrinent analysis use that
7/5/23, 5:18 PM - Nithin AIML: Finally.... These 3 are for cleaning data n further will be discussed later as cleaning itself is 90%of job in data science
7/5/23, 5:18 PM - Nithin AIML: Hope my points are clear feel free to ask anything if u didn't get
7/5/23, 5:19 PM - Nithin AIML: Guys pls work n be interactive
7/5/23, 5:39 PM - nagaraj_poojari: 👍
7/5/23, 7:13 PM - nagaraj_poojari: i think we are calculating macro F1 wrong way
7/5/23, 7:13 PM - nagaraj_poojari: it is giving diff ans with diff library functions
7/5/23, 7:17 PM - Nithin AIML: What lib u have gone through
7/5/23, 7:17 PM - nagaraj_poojari: tensorflow , sklearn
7/5/23, 7:18 PM - Nithin AIML: Check how they both calculate
7/5/23, 7:20 PM - nagaraj_poojari: k
7/6/23, 3:18 PM - nagaraj_poojari: basically idea is to get relationship between a text with its labels
7/6/23, 3:18 PM - nagaraj_poojari: we are not passing one hot encoding of the label ,but a short text explaining that label
7/6/23, 3:18 PM - nagaraj_poojari: <Media omitted>
7/6/23, 3:18 PM - nagaraj_poojari: <Media omitted>
7/6/23, 3:18 PM - nagaraj_poojari: rather than attention model , we can try a Siamese network
7/6/23, 8:24 PM - nagaraj_poojari: training f1 macro - 0.97
validation f1 macro ~ 0.65
7/6/23, 8:26 PM - Nithin AIML: How
7/6/23, 8:26 PM - Nithin AIML: Which model
7/6/23, 8:30 PM - nagaraj_poojari: just fine tuning Bert
7/6/23, 8:33 PM - Nithin AIML: What tuning u did
7/6/23, 8:34 PM - nagaraj_poojari: nothing special, just used Huggingface to import Bert ,then run few epochs on our dataset
7/6/23, 8:35 PM - Nithin AIML: Any extra in cleaning other than mine
7/6/23, 8:57 PM - nagaraj_poojari: nothing
7/7/23, 1:05 PM - Nithin AIML: Lets meet after AEC
7/7/23, 1:05 PM - Nithin AIML: At 2:45
